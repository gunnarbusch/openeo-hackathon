# openEO Hackathon - Solution R client / GeoPyspark back-end

## Task 1

Installing and loading the required packages:
```{r}
install.packages("devtools")
require("devtools")

# Sometimes the devtools fail to install some dependencies.
# You may need to install Rcpp and rlang manually by uncommenting thw following two lines:
# install.packages("Rcpp")
# install.packages("rlang")

install_github(repo="Open-EO/openeo-r-client",ref="develop",dependencies=TRUE)
require("openeo")
```

Connecting to the openEO Earth Engine back-end. You may need to change the credentials:
```{r}
con = connect("http://openeo.vgt.vito.be/openeo")
```

Requesting the capabilities that are provided by the back-end:
```{r}
con %>% listCapabilities()
```

## Task 2

Requesting the processes offered by the back-end:
```{r}
con %>% listProcesses()
```

Requesting the arguments required for the ndvi process:
```{r}
# con %>% describeProcess("NDVI")
```

Requesting the products offered by the back-end:
```{r}
# con %>% listCollections()
```

Requesting information about the Sentinel-2 dataset, including the temporal and spatial extent:
```{r}
# sentinel2 = "COPERNICUS/S2"
# s2 = con %>% describeCollection(sentinel2) # This may take some time to complete if GDAL is not installed
# s2
# s2$time
# s2$extent
```

## Task 3

First of all, requesting the supported file formats to see whether PNG or GeoTiff (GTiff) is supported and color stretching is required for PNG files or not:
```{r}
# con %>% listFormats()
```
Only PNG files are supported and therefore we need to apply color stretching.

We construct the process graph using a process graph builder. The following steps are required:

1. Construct the process graph builder
2. Specify the required dataset
3. Filtering by date range
4. Filtering by bounding box
5. Calculating the NDVI on the red band B4 and the near-infrared band B8
6. Computing a minimum time composite
7. Strecthing the colors
8. Executing the process graph on the back-end, requesting a PNG file with the name `task3.png`

```{r}
pgb = con %>% pgb()

task = collection(sentinel2,id_name = "product_id") %>% 
  pgb$filter_daterange(from = "2018-01-01", to= "2018-01-15") %>% 
  pgb$filter_bbox(left = 16.138916,top= 48.320647, right= 16.524124, bottom= 48.138600, srs="EPSG:4326") %>%
  pgb$NDVI(red = "B4", nir = "B8") %>%
  pgb$min_time() %>%
  pgb$stretch_colors(min = -1, max = 1)

# con %>% executeTask(task=task, format = "PNG", output_file = "task3.png")
```

## Task 4

Checking if the process `zonal_statistics` is provided by the back-end:
```{r}
# con %>% describeProcess("zonal_statistics")
```

If you haven't done so yet, download the GeoJSON file containing the poylgon:
```{r}
polygonURL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Open-EO/openeo-hackathon/master/test-cases/task-4/polygon.json"
download.file(polygonURL, "polygon.json", quiet=TRUE)
```

Uploading the GeoJSON file containing the poylgon:
```{r}
# con %>% uploadUserData(content="polygon.json",target="polygon.json",encode="raw",mime="application/octet-stream")
```

Construct and execute the process graph. Downloads the file in JSON format with the file name `task5.json`:
```{r}
task5 = collection(sentinel2,id_name = "product_id") %>% 
  pgb$filter_daterange(from = "2018-01-01", to= "2018-01-15") %>% 
  pgb$filter_bbox(left = 16.138916,top= 48.320647, right= 16.524124, bottom= 48.138600, srs="EPSG:4326") %>%
  pgb$filter_bands(bands = "B8") %>%
  pgb$zonal_statistics(regions = "polygon.json", func = "mean")

# con %>% executeTask(task=task5, format="JSON", output_file = "task5.json")
```

## Task 5

TBD
